# Raspberry Pi NAS App

## Project Overview
This project is Network-Attached Storage (NAS) application created by my team of 4 that allows you to upload, download, manage, and organize files on a Raspberry Pi. 

The API and doxygen comments files aren't included due to file size limits.

## Requirements

- QT Creator 6.0+
- C++17 or higher

## Running the Project:
### Step 1: Run the API
1. Clone the project:

```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.sci.uwo.ca/courses/2025/01/COMPSCI3307/group51.git
```


2. Go to the API directory:

```sh
   cd group51/API
```


3. Build and run the API:

```sh
   make
   ./api
```


    This will start the API. 
    For more info on the API, refer to API/README.md.

### Step 2: Run the Front End

1.  Open the project in Qt Creator (version 6.0 or later):

2. Navigate to the Local Drive project directory.

3.  Open the project file in Qt Creator.

4.  Build and run the application:

- Click the "Rebuild" button to compile the project.

- Once built, click "Run" to launch the Local Drive app.

#### That's it! Your Local Drive application should now be up and running with both the API and frontend working together.
